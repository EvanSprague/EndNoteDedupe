most patients were in an icu. picc-related bsi was confirmed in each case by demonstrating concordance between isolates colonizing the picc at the time of removal and from blood cultures by restriction-fragment dna subtyping. results: overall, 115 patients had 251 piccs placed. mean duration of catheterization was 11.3 days (total, 2,832 picc-days); 42% of the patients were in an icu at some time, 62% had urinary catheters, and 49% had received mechanical ventilation. six picc-related bsis were identified (2.4%), four with coagulase-negative staphylococcus, one with staphylococcus aureus, and one with klebsiella pneumoniae, a rate of 2.1 per 1,000 catheter-days. conclusion: this prospective study shows that piccs used in high-risk hospitalized patients are associated with a rate of catheter-related bsi similar to conventional cvcs placed in the internal jugular or subclavian veins (2 to 5 per 1,000 catheter-days), much higher than with piccs used exclusively in the outpatient setting (approximately 0.4 per 1,000 catheter-days), and higher than with cufled and tunneled hickman-like cvcs (approximately 1 per 1,000 catheter-days). a randomized trial of piccs and conventional cvcs in hospitalized patients requiring central access is needed. our data raise the question of whether the growing trend in many hospital hematology and oncology services to switch from use of cuffed and tunneled cvcs to piccs is justified, particularly since piccs are more vulnerable to thrombosis and dislodgment, and are less useful for drawing blood specimens. moreover, piccs are not advisable in patients with renal failure and impending need for dialysis, in whom preservation of upper-extremity veins is needed for fistula or graft implantation."}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"ENID": "300", "Authors": null, "Title": "nurses team up to prevent clabsi", "Journal": "nursing", "Year": "2012", "Vol": "42", "Issue": "12", "Pages": "19-19", "DOI": "10.1097/01.nurse.0000422655.38534.0a", "ISSN/ISBN": "0360-4039", "Search": "general", "Database": "cinahl", "Abst": null}, {"ENID": "5254", "Authors": "wild c;

there is a need to provide guidance for clinicians by reviewing current studies systematically. objectives: to assess the effects of pvc dressings and securement devices on the incidence of pvc failure. search methods: we searched the following electronic databases to identify reports of relevant randomised controlled trials (rcts): the cochrane wounds group register (searched 08 april 2015): the cochrane central register of controlled trials (central;

(2) cmv ra, no agvhd; (3) no cmv ra, agvhd; and (4) cmv ra and agvhd. results: most transplant patients had aml in cr1, received mud pbsc grafts following myeloablative conditioning, and were given methotrexate and calcineurin-based gvhd prophylaxis. patients who developed agvhd grades 2 (hr=1.93, 95% ci 1.15-3.23, p=0.013) or grades 3 and 4 (hr=3.36, 95% ci 1.76-6.45, p<0.001) had higher risk for developing subsequent cmv ra. in contrast, patients with initial cmv ra did not have increased risk for developing future agvhd. similarly, cmv ra did not have a significant impact on future infection, regardless of infection type, nor impact subsequent risk of malignant disease relapse. overall survival (os) at 1, 2, and 3 years post-transplant were 63%, 53%, and 45%, respectively. cumulative incidence rates for non-relapse mortality (nrm) at 1, 2, and 3 years were 16%, 19%, and 23%, respectively;

only 6'66% of the cases developed a catheter related blood stream infection (crbsi) and no cases of thrombosis or occlusion were found. this low rate of complications also found in other recent studies seems to be related to the improvements in the insertion technique and in the development and strict observance of catheter care and maintenance protocols. yet, the need to remove the picc in order to insert a central venous access with more lumens is a fact we can't ignore because it means a 20% of our sample. the kind of treatment, its duration and the patient characteristics should be carefully considered before choosing a central venous access in order to avoid unnecessary insertions."}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"ENID": "3230", "Authors": "li y;

mda-5 is a major inducer of interferons, thus recruiting cd8 cells, which play a crucial role in controlling hiv replication. there was significant downregulation of tlr-6 expression in patients with hiv-neurotb co-infection as compared to neurotb alone. interestingly, tlr-6 has been associated with recognition of mycobacterial antigens and its downregulation may contribute to neuropathogenesis of tb. tlrs 1, 3 and 9 expression was significantly downregulated in all patients with neurotb, irrespective of hiv co-infection suggesting a protective role for these tlrs in host response to tb. further studies on tlrs and other pattern recognition receptors in hiv-tb co-infected individuals would help understand pathogenesis and dissemination of the disease and may contribute to development of better therapeutic strategies."}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__": [{"ENID": "1277", "Authors": "leszek j;", "Title": "disturbances of innate immunity in alzheimer's disease: possible
